- [x] Create resources/views/admin_prodi/field_supervisors/index.blade.php (table with ID, Name, Email, Institution, Status, Actions)
- [x] Create resources/views/admin_prodi/field_supervisors/create.blade.php
- [x] Create resources/views/admin_prodi/field_supervisors/edit.blade.php
- [x] Add field-supervisors routes in web.php (index, create, store, edit, update, destroy, toggle-active)
- [x] Add field supervisors link in ADMIN_PRODI menu in sidebar.blade.php
- [x] Add field supervisors link in "Data & Statistik" section and add field_supervisors count to stats in admin_prodi/index.blade.php

## Followup steps
- [ ] Test accessing the field supervisors page
- [ ] Verify company relationships display correctly

## New Task: Auto-assign Field Supervisor when Supervisor Approves KP Application

## Information Gathered
- Supervisor approves KP application in Supervisor/VerificationController.php approve() method, changing status to 'APPROVED'
- Field supervisors are assigned to companies via CompanyFieldSupervisor model
- Currently field_supervisor_id is assigned manually by admin
- Need to auto-assign field_supervisor_id when supervisor approves KP application with approved title
- Only assign if company_id exists and field_supervisor_id is null

## Plan
- [x] Modify Supervisor/VerificationController.php approve() method to auto-assign field_supervisor_id
- [x] Use CompanyFieldSupervisor::where('company_id', $kpApplication->company_id)->value('field_supervisor_id') to get supervisor
- [x] Add logic after status update to set field_supervisor_id if available
- [x] Ensure assignment only happens for applications with company_id (not custom companies)

## Dependent Files to be edited
- app/Http/Controllers/Supervisor/VerificationController.php

## Followup steps
- [ ] Test auto-assignment by creating KP application, submitting, and having supervisor approve
- [ ] Verify field supervisor can see the student in their activities/students page
- [ ] Check edge cases (custom companies, no field supervisor assigned to company)
