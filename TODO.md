# TODO: Create Student Dashboard

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Modify DashboardController to show dashboard view for MAHASISWA role instead of redirecting to kp-applications.index
- [x] Create resources/views/student/dashboard.blade.php with overview content:
  - Welcome message
  - KP Application status summary
  - Recent mentoring logs
  - Recent activity logs
  - Quick action links
- [x] Update sidebar link if needed (currently points to dashboard route)
- [x] Test the dashboard functionality

## Information Gathered
- Current DashboardController redirects students to kp-applications.index
- Student sidebar has "Dashboard" link pointing to route('dashboard')
- Student views are in resources/views/student/
- Layout uses app.blade.php
- Student role is 'MAHASISWA'

## Plan
Create a comprehensive student dashboard showing key information and quick access to main features.
