# TODO: Add Approve/Reject Buttons for Activity Logs in Field Supervisor Student Detail Page

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Add routes for approve/revise activity logs in field supervisor section
- [x] Update view to show approve/revise buttons for each activity log
- [x] Test the approval functionality

## Information Gathered
- ActivityLogController has approve() and revise() methods
- Routes need to be added under field-supervisor prefix
- View needs to show buttons conditionally based on status

## Plan
Add approve and revise buttons directly in the student detail page for field supervisors to quickly approve/reject activity logs without navigating to separate pages.
